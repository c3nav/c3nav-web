  <h4>Data privacy</h4>
  <p>We do not collect any personal data.</p>
  <p>Any data that your device sends to c3nav that might be used to track you will either be discarded after processing it or saved in a way that does not allow us to connect it to you.</p><p>If you register an account, we do not ask for personal data either.</p>
  <p>The only exception to this is the &quot;custom positions&quot; feature. If you create a custom position, you are able to share a location publicly on our website. You will likely use this to share your own location so in this case, this data will be stored. You can unset or delete this data at any time and we do not save any location history.</p>
